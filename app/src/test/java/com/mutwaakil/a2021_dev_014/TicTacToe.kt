class TicTacToe {

//    X always goes first.
//    Players cannot play on a played position.
//    Players alternate placing X’s and O’s on the board until either:
//
  //    One player has three in a row, horizontally, vertically or diagonally
  //    All nine squares are filled.
//
//    If a player is able to draw three X’s or three O’s in a row, that player wins.
//    If all nine squares are filled and neither player has three in a row, the game is a draw
